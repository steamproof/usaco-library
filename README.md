# usaco-library

C++ algorithm/data structure library organized by **USACO division** (Bronze → Platinum).

## Important
This repository is **NOT allowed to be used during official USACO contests** (no external code libraries). It exists for practice, learning, and building your own understanding/template.

## Topics
Topics are based on [USACO Guide](https://usaco.guide/) coverage, but the repo is not intended to mirror the Guide’s exact navigation beyond division level.

## Status
This project is still under development and is meant to provide a full library for competitive programmers competing in USACO up to platinum.
